;;; The appearance (dark or light title bar and frame) of a Cocoa window.
;;;
;;; Every GUI frontend on macOS draws into an NSWindow, so a frontend
;;; implements LEM-IF:SET-FRAME-COLOR by passing its own NSWindow here.
;;; Taking the window explicitly, rather than [NSApp keyWindow], changes
;;; the right window even when another one has focus, or none does yet.
;;;
;;; cl-objc supports macOS on arm64 only; elsewhere these are no-ops.
